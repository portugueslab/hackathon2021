# Hackathon2021
Folder with the material of the Portugues lab hackaton 2021

## Organisation
The hackathon will consist of alternating sessions of:

1) **Tutorials** in Python and data analysis, with different degrees of difficulty (maybe 1/2 per day, ~0.5-1h long + long intro the first day); people should feel free to assist to the the ones they feel useful for them. The tutorials will happen through notebooks whenever possible, and should have parts with little exercises and not just frontal lecturing.
2) **Work on small projects** in groups of 2 people for the rest of the time. For this people should work at their own pace, ideally in pairs of different coding skills levels. I (Luigi) will be around most of the time to help out people discussing projects and helping figuring things out, so that no one is stuck for too long. At the end of the week, maybe the last afternoon, there can be presentations about what has been done during the week.

## Program
The hackathon will take place from 15th to 19th of February. This is a temptative schedule, that we can revisit as we go:
 - Day 1: (maybe, if enough people want it) long intro to Python ecosystem: Python, Anaconda, conda, Jupyter, PyCharm, git/GitHub (morning); beginning of project work (afternoon)
 - Day 2: Project work + 1/2 lectures (tba)
 - Day 3: Project work + 1/2 lectures (tba)
 - Day 4: Project work + 1/2 lectures (tba)
 - Day 5: Project work (morning); projects presentation (afternoon)
